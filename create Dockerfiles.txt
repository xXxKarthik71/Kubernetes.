To create Dockerfiles for your application, you need to define the base image, the working directory, and the required dependencies. Here's an example Dockerfile for a Node.js application:


FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
