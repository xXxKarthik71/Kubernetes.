To deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster, apply the Kubernetes manifests using the following command:

kubectl apply -f my-app-manifest.yaml

Once the deployment is successful, you can access the application using the LoadBalancer or NodePort service URL, or through an ingress if configured.
